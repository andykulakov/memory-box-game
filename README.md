Memory Box Game - React App

You have 16 dark boxes on the screen. Each box hides one color.

You click on a box - it shows you the color underneath. 

Now you need to find the box that hides the matching color - there is only one such box somewhere on your screen. 

If you click on the wrong box - oops, boxes turn grey again.

If you click on the right one - the two mathing boxes stay colorful until the end of the game. Now you have less options to choose from so it's easier to play.

Be ready for a difficult game - many colors look almost identical but in fact they are not.
